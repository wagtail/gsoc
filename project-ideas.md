# Project ideas

🚧 please refer to our [contributor guide](http://wagtail.org/gsoc-guide/) that sets expectations for contributors, and in particular our [AI policy](http://wagtail.org/gsoc-ai/) to understand what generative AI use is acceptable when taking part in Google Summer of Code with Wagtail.

## Demo website redesign

### Summary

The [Wagtail UI team](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/UI-team) is kickstarting an incremental redesign of the [Wagtail bakery demo site](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo), with the intention to make it a more suitable demo for larger projects, and other verticals than breadmaking. As part of Google Summer of Code, help us implement the new design.

### Expected outcomes

- New visual design for the site
- Refactorings to simplify long-term maintenance of the site
- Capabilities to test Wagtail with large amounts of content

### Implementation

We will work exclusively on the bakery demo project, implementing the designs produced by the UI team. Implementing new site functionality to better demo Wagtail. Changes will be made iteratively so other contributors benefit from every improvement as they are made.

### Skills

- Front-end web development with Django, HTML, vanilla CSS
- Backend web development with Django, Python

## Starter kit upgrade

### Summary

Our [news template](https://github.com/wagtail/news-template) is intended as a great starting point to Wagtail, but it’s hard to use and also to maintain. We want to iterate on its implementation so it better serves its purpose as the best place to go when trying out Wagtail.

### Expected outcomes

- A new version of the starter kit demonstrating the latest Wagtail features
- Automation to keep the starter kit up-to-date
- TBC: different variations of the starter kit

### Implementation

All changes will be implemented to the news template. First with a discovery phase to confirm what is feasible within the Google Summer of Code timeline. Then iterative development of planned improvements.

### Skills

- Backend web development with Django, Python
- Bonus: Front-end web development with Django, HTML, vanilla CSS
- Bonus: expertise with DevOps, automation, package management

### Mentors

- Lead: Meagen Voss
- Support: TBC

## Multilingual support improvements

### Summary

We want to make widespread improvements to Wagtail’s capabilities that are relevant to multilingual websites, both in the core CMS and in packages like [wagtail-localize](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-localize). We have [extensive feedback from our community](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/13693) on possible improvements. Feature requests, long-standing bugs, maintenance hurdles. There are a lot of options with this project.

### Expected outcomes

- Better core support for common multilingual requirements, shipping in our August 2026 and November 2026 releases.
- Better support for automation in translation workflows.
- Demonstration of those changes on our [multilingual user guide website](http://guide.wagtail.org/).
- TBC: complementary improvements to packages that build upon core features (wagtail-localize or others)

### Implementation

There will be a discovery phase where we refine exactly which improvements are feasible. This will be based on talking to analyzing user needs and researching any dependencies of possible improvements. We will then proceed with pull requests to Wagtail core, per improvement.

There is also likely a need for documentation writing - explaining how to get the best results with Wagtail.

### Skills

- Understanding of internationalization needs
- Backend web development with Django, Python
- Bonus: front-end web development
- Bonus: expertise with machine translation tools

### Mentors

- Lead: Thibaud Colas
- Support: Coen van der Kamp, Sævar Öfjörð Magnússon

## Project proposal: your own idea

You can also propose your own idea. Your proposal should:

- Have a concrete task.
- Give a solid idea of what will constitute success. You tell us.
- Present a detailed design specification.
- Give insight into who you are. If you propose something ambitious, convince us that you are up to the task.
- Give insight into your previous projects and experience.
- Tell us about your experience with Python/Django/Wagtail.
- Provide a schedule, including a detailed work breakdown and major milestones.
- Contain your motivation and curriculum vitae.

Note:

- The project ideas above are starting points for your submission, but aren’t enough by themselves. You’ll need to come up with a more complete project plan, and use your own words.
- Do not feel limited to the project ideas below.
- If you have a project idea not listed, please direct message the [organisation admins](#organisation-admins). They can test the project eligibility and pair you with a mentor for initial feedback.

Project proposals should fall into one of three categories:

- Work on Wagtail itself. The core product.
- Work on tools to support Wagtail. Example: Editor guide as a Wagtail website.
- Wagtail packages. Example: [Wagtail Live](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live) is a GSOC 2021 project.

The project you propose should be:

- Something useful for the Wagtail project
- A single well-scoped project
- Achievable within the time of GSoC
- And something the core developers can help mentor you on.
