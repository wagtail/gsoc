# Contributor guide

👋 This guide is our main resource for contributors interested in working on Wagtail as part of the Google Summer of Code programme. Please read through it all, top to bottom.

## About Wagtail

<!-- Note for maintainers: matches the "Organization Description" field on https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/wagtail/profile. -->

Wagtail is a popular content management system. It's built on Python and Django, by an active and engaged open source community, which has grown rapidly since Wagtail's release in 2014. Wagtail is available in over 40 languages, and used by some of the world's best-known organizations, including NASA, Google, Mozilla, MIT, and the UK's National Health Service, as well as museums, universities, non-profits, governments, banks, studios, restaurants, startups and bloggers around the world. Like Python and Django, the technologies which underpin it, Wagtail is known for its welcoming community.

### Our community

Here are options to get to know our community:

1. Read our recent posts: [Wagtail nominated for TWO CMS Critic Awards! 🏆](https://wagtail.org/blog/wagtail-nominated-for-two-cms-critic-awards/) (give us a vote!), [Open source AI we use to work on Wagtail](https://wagtail.org/blog/open-source-ai-we-use-to-work-on-wagtail/)
2. Sign up for [our newsletter](https://wagtail.org/newsletter/), [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@wagtailcms), or follow us [on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/wagtail-cms/), [on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/wagtail.org), or [on Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@wagtail)
3. Join [our Slack community workspace](http://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/wiki/Slack).

## Selection criteria

We use the same [eligibility criteria](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq) as every other GSoC participating organization. Participation is open to all who are eligible to Google Summer of Code.

We’re about **quality over quantity**. We favor candidates that:

1. Demonstrate a good understanding of our project ethos and open source values, via consistency in communications with our contributors.
2. Demonstrate their expertise with the topic of their proposal, either via the proposal itself or via few, strategic high-quality contributions.

We encourage trying to contribute to an area related to your proposal during the 3-4 weeks leading to applications opening.

## Project proposals

We select projects based on the final proposals submitted via the Google Summer of Code platform. Make sure to follow [our AI policy for GSoC](http://wagtail.org/gsoc-ai/) when working on proposals. We provide an optional [GSoC proposal template](https://wagtail.org/gsoc-template/). We’ve created this template to help people put together a well structured proposal. Following the template isn’t mandatory, we just hope it will help you understand what we are after.

Once proposals open, we also provide a [review form for early feedback on proposals](https://wagtail.org/gsoc-proposal). We strive to review submissions on a regular basis, providing feedback directly on proposal documents.

## Contributor tasks

We recommend participants go through a set of initial tasks as they start to get involved with Wagtail’s community, ahead of their application. This is for you to get to know Wagtail as a project and community, and get a sense of how we can work together. It also helps mentors assess the skills of candidates, so we can decide which projects we can take on with you. Those tasks are all optional -- if you’re confident in your abilities, the only requirement is to submit your application via the [Google Summer of Code platform](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).

No matter which specific project idea you’re interested in, we expect all participants to demonstrate:

- A good **understanding of Google Summer of Code**.
- Awareness of **how open source contributors collaborate**: clear and effective communication, usage of english, online etiquette, code of conduct, communication channels.
- Awareness of our **[AI policy for GSoC](http://wagtail.org/gsoc-ai/)**, relevant across all aspects of your participation.
- An **interest in learning**: improving in response to feedback, asking questions when appropriate, and helping other contributors.
- Awareness of **git and GitHub and contribution guidelines** to contribute to large code projects.
- Proficiency with **Django, Python, and Wagtail**.

### Checklists
