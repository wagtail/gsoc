# Introduction

Hi @wagtail community. 

I'm Abinash from the Netherlands. I've had quite some friends around me who had been GSoC contributors in the past and that is exactly what motivated me to apply for the same this year. ðŸ˜„ I'm doing Masters in Computational Science. Python is the language that I use on a daily basis apart from JavaScript. I have been contributing to open-source for quite some time now, with more interest after my winning experience in the past [`Hacktoberfest`](https://www.holopin.io/@abinashbunty#badges). 

I freelance for an e-commerce company. And that is precisely how I come across numerous CMS on a regular basis. Since I'm focused on building and managing API connectors for inventory management (WooCommerce, Shopify, Magento, etc.) and writing technical documentation for the same, I had somehow not come across Wagtail earlier. Just quite some months ago I got to know about this Python based CMS and that just made me so happy! I have been following the project for a while after that and plan to build my [personal website](https://www.abinash.nl/) on Wagtail in near future. ðŸ˜‰ 

I am glad that Wagtail got selected for GSoC and I'm hoping to be part of the community through my future contributions. ðŸ˜„ Once again, warm greetings to everyone in the wagtail community.

## Tasks

### Checklist: open source contributions

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).
- [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your Twitter profile if any
  - [x] Your Mastodown profile if any
  - [x] Your LinkedIn profile if any
  - [x] Your personal website
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your participant file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to make all of the above changes in a single pull request.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [x] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within this `gsoc` repository in the `2023/` folder.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific GSoC project idea youâ€™re interested in.
- [ ] Go through our projects under the [wagtail organisation](https://github.com/wagtail) in GitHub. Create a new list with links to repositories or specific issues you would be interested in contributing to during the internship.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Django and Wagtail

Here, we expect you to go through two tutorials to demonstrate your understanding of Django and Wagtail. Submit both projects you will have created as a pull request on this `gsoc` repository.

- [ ] Go through Djangoâ€™s [Getting started documentation and tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/), until part 7.
- [ ] Go through Wagtailâ€™s Getting started tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)


## Research

- I'm interested to contribute to the `Greener coding` project. Often while developing applications, I tend to focus on the fast response time of the application. But I have never thought much about the energy consumption of the application. I'm interested to learn more about this project and contribute to it.
- [Create Low-Carbon Images](https://climateaction.tech/actions/create-low-carbon-images/) - This provides some information about optimizing images for the web. I'm interested to learn more about this.
- [How CSS Sprites Improve Speed And Sustainability](https://www.mightybytes.com/blog/css-sprites/) - This article talks about how CSS sprites can improve the speed and sustainability of the web.

Both the above resources are quite interesting for me to work on. Most importantly, this will help me in focusing and managing the `green side` of a project as well which is very crucial.
