## Introduction
Hello everyone,
My name is Manish Dhakal, and I am from Nepal. I have good experience in a python programming language.
I am excited about the opportunity to participate in Google Summer of Code and contribute to open source. In particular, I am interested in working with Wagtail and starting my journey in open-source development.

# Contributor guide

ðŸ‘‹ This guide is our main resource for contributors interested in working on Wagtail as part of the Google Summer of Code programme. Please read through it all, top to bottom.

## About Wagtail

<!-- Note for maintainers: matches the "Organization Description" field on https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/wagtail/profile. -->

Wagtail is a popular content management system. It's built on Python and Django, by an active and engaged open source community, which has grown rapidly since Wagtail's release in 2014. Wagtail is available in over 40 languages, and used by some of the world's best-known organizations, including NASA, Google, Mozilla, MIT, and the UK's National Health Service, as well as museums, universities, non-profits, governments, banks, studios, restaurants, startups and bloggers around the world. Like Python and Django, the technologies which underpin it, Wagtail is known for its welcoming community.

## GSoC eligibility criteria

We use the same [eligibility criteria](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/faq#what_are_the_eligibility_requirements_for_participation) as every other GSoC participating organization. In particular

## Contributor tasks

We expect participants to go through a set of initial tasks as they start to get involved with Wagtailâ€™s community, ahead of their application. This is for you to get to know Wagtail as a project and community, and get a sense of how we can work together. It also helps mentors assess the skills of candidates, so we can decide which projects we can take on with you.

No matter which specific project idea youâ€™re interested in, we expect all participants to demonstrate:

- A good **understanding of Google Summer of Code**.
- Awareness of **how open source contributors collaborate**: clear and effective communication, usage of english, online etiquette, code of conduct, communication channels.
- An **interest in learning**: improving in response to feedback, asking questions when appropriate, and helping other contributors.
- Awareness of **git and GitHub and contribution guidelines** to contribute to large code projects.
- Proficiency with **Django, Python, and Wagtail**.

### Improve your chances of being accepted

The best thing you can do to improve your chances of being accepted as a Wagtail GSoC contributor is to start being involved now. Make yourself known to the community. Go through our checklists, recommended tutorials, and help fellow contributors who are going through the same process. Try to contribute to an area related to your proposal. When the time comes to evaluate applications, you will be a known individual.

We're here to help, but we can't watch you every step of the way. We need to see motivation from you. Your activities before the submissions process are the best way to demonstrate this. Any application submitted late, from people we havenâ€™t heard from before, will be considered with a lot of skepticism.

### Checklists

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure youâ€™re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Google Summer of Code

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through. Itâ€™s a good idea to start early, so you can get to know the community and the project.

- [x] Watch the official [â€˜Introduction to GSoCâ€™ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD2tChhrWM&feature=youtu.be).
- [x] Read [Advise for People Applying for GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice).

- [x] Read the official [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and add the most important dates as reminders on your calendar.

Youâ€™ve done the hardest bits! Now all thatâ€™s left is for you to:

- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions/1) discussion thread.

### Checklist: open source contributions

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)

- [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHubâ€™s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [ ] Your Twitter profile if any
  - [ ] Your Mastodown profile if any
  - [ ] Your LinkedIn profile if any
  - [ ] Your personal website
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your participant file, and copy-paste our contributor guideâ€™s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to make all of the above changes in a single pull request.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests â€“ spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [ ] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within this `gsoc` repository in the `2023/` folder.

- [ ] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources youâ€™ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific GSoC project idea youâ€™re interested in.
- [ ] Go through our projects under the [wagtail organisation](https://github.com/wagtail) in GitHub. Create a new list with links to repositories or specific issues you would be interested in contributing to during the internship.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things youâ€™ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Django and Wagtail

Here, we expect you to go through two tutorials to demonstrate your understanding of Django and Wagtail. Submit both projects you will have created as a pull request on this `gsoc` repository.

- [x] Go through Djangoâ€™s [Getting started documentation and tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/), until part 7.
- [x] Go through Wagtailâ€™s Getting started tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)
