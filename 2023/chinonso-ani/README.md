## Warm Intros

Shoutout to the team @torchbox, and fellow GSOC enthusiasts. 
My name is Chinonso Ani, but you can call me _The Prince of Wales_. I've been a software engineer for sometime, until beginning a Masters in Advanced Computer Science at Cardiff. Used Python/Django for a large part of my working career, also PHP, JS, DevOps, et al.

On arriving in the UK, I looked up meetup to find tech meetups... and then I saw Django Social at Torchbox Bristol office in Jan... wow! Having worked with wagtail, what pleasure it would be to finally meet with the creators. When I did step into the office, it was that childlike feeling of going to Disneyland for the first time. Pure excitement, real joy!

I spoke with Jon, who introduced me to Naomi... cos in Jon's words... "they're always recruiting"... and I was looking for something to do part-time, but it wasn't just a job, it was mentorship + contribution I was looking for. I've always been a Startup engineer, a bulk of my experience has been beginning projects or migrating them, being a self starter and trying to evaluate my work based on "industry standards."

## Motivations

In the mail I did to Naomi afterwards, I wrote:

> Based on what is on Wagtail's roadmap (but it doesn't have to be Wagtail) about Multi-channel experiences - what exactly is the core team considering?

- Non-profit/ Not-for-profits usually collect a lot of data, how many use Wagtail to do that? How efficient is that process? What can be improved?

- Do the [wagtail] clients need some form of Geo-spatial data/ integration into Wagtail? Postgres supports this, and no other CMS does this well (first party)

- What is top of mind to clients at this time - apart from how to use ChatGPT? But wait a minute, is it possible to build a Language model into Wagtail? Does ChatWagtail sound appealing? What would be the use case(s)? Maybe FAQ chatbot

- What is the engineering team(s) considering that they've said "we'll need a detailed research into this?" 

- Does Torchbox have a list of proposed research objectives? Where can I find such?

> All the above are just questions to trigger some thought. At the end of my program, what if I could present to Torchbox - a critical mass of well designed and architected system - that points to a desirable future.

Unfortunately I didn't hear back, but I know her, when we spoke in person during the meetup, she told me her email/ LinkedIn is swamped, especially when you're a recruiter, I can empathize how her inboxes look, so I understood. I honestly didn't know how to start because this is actually my first time making an open source contribution. I was sad for a while...

Fast forward to Feb, I was in Bristol again for PyData at Cookpad, and then I heard about GSOC from the 4th Presenter Lenka... and I was like huh... what is that? I checked it up and Lo and behold... Wagtail!

Exactly what I wanted - Open source contribution with my favorite Python CMS framework + mentorship. It was a no-brainer... we are going HEAD FIRST WAGTAIL!

What is really amazing about Wagtail is how the teams I've worked with has used it and how it has inspired how we designed our own apps in Head/Headless manner... especially the {shouting} awesome StreamFields! Just look at the engineering of that piece of Model field... pure genius!

My drive is to contribute as much as possible in this season and hopefully by this time next year, be a mentor spearheading GSOC for the next set of awesome enthusiasts coming to Wagtail. Open source to me, is about getting value and giving it all back to the community.


## Tasks
### Checklists

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure you’re on the right track.

- [x] Read the official [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and add the most important dates as reminders on your calendar.

- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions/1) discussion thread.

### Checklist: open source contributions

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)

- [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Django and Wagtail

Here, we expect you to go through two tutorials to demonstrate your understanding of Django and Wagtail. Submit both projects you will have created as a pull request on this `gsoc` repository.
