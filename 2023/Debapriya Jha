Hello everyone, my name is Debapriya and I'm a second-year engineering student in India. I am excited to be joining this community! I am a software developer 
with experience in Java, C++, and Python. I am also familiar with web development technologies such as HTML, CSS,  JavaScript, machine learning concepts, Django, 
and PHP. I am interested in contributing to Wagtail and learning more about its technologies and functionalities.

I am eager to use my skills to make meaningful contributions to the project and work with the team to improve its features and functionalities. This will be my 
first open-source contribution and I am looking forward to learning from the community and contributing to the growth of the project.

I am open to any suggestions on how I can get started and learn more about Wagtail's technologies. I am excited to collaborate and contribute to this project.
