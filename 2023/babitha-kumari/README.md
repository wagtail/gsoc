## Introduction

Hey everyone!
I am Babitha Kumari, a 3rd year Computer Science Engineering student at CMR Institute of Technology, Bengaluru, India.

I have been working as a web developer. My skillset includes HTML,CSS,Javascript,Python and Django.
I have used Django to build several real world projects and therefore have a strong grip on the framework.GSOC is an amazing opportunity to contribute to open source and I've been looking forward to working with Wagtail whilst starting out my own journey into open source.

Looking forward to learning and working with the Wagtail community.

## Tasks

### Checklists

We use checklists so all candidates demonstrate their interest and skills with the same process. They will help you get started and make sure you’re on the right track.

#### Checklist: Google Summer of Code

This is the first checklist for candidates to go through. It’s a good idea to start early, so you can get to know the community and the project.

- [x] Watch the official [‘Introduction to GSoC’ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jD2tChhrWM&feature=youtu.be).
- [x] Read [Advise for People Applying for GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-advice).
- [x] Read all of Google’s [contributor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/)
- [x] Read the official [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and add the most important dates as reminders on your calendar.

You’ve done the hardest bits! Now all that’s left is for you to:

- [x] Introduce yourself on our [Welcome to Wagtail! Introductions](https://github.com/wagtail/gsoc/discussions/1) discussion thread.

### Checklist: open source contributions

This checklist helps you demonstrate your understanding of how people use GitHub to collaborate.

- [x] Read through [How to contribute to open source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [x] Read [Open source etiquette](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Open_source_etiquette)
- [x] Make your first [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) with us! Add your name to the list of participants in [2023/README.md](2023/README.md).
- [x] Clone this repository, then add a new folder inside `2023/` with your name as the folder name. Inside that folder, add a `README.md` file, and copy-paste the introduction you posted earlier. Submit this to our project as a pull request.
- [x] Read through GitHub’s [Markdown formatting documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- [x] Now make another pull request to your own README file, adding a Markdown table with links to:
  - [x] Your GitHub profile
  - [x] Your Twitter profile
  - [ ] Your Mastodown profile if any
  - [x] Your LinkedIn profile if any
  - [x] Your personal website
- [x] Update your pull request to add a new `## Tasks` section to your participant file, and copy-paste our contributor guide’s checklists into it, marking each item as completed or not according to your progress.

For participants already experienced with GitHub and Markdown, feel free to make all of the above changes in a single pull request.

To stand out as an applicant,

- [ ] Help others with their pull requests – spotting steps they might have missed, or suggesting improvements to their pull requests.
- [x] Demonstrate good awareness of open source etiquette when creating your pull requests (for example, adding an appropriate title and description).

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within this `gsoc` repository in the `2023/` folder.

- [x] Create a new `## Research` section in your personal file, with a list of links to the resources you’ve found most useful so far in trying to understand Wagtail as a project and the specific GSoC project idea you’re interested in.
- [x] Go through our projects under the [wagtail organisation](https://github.com/wagtail) in GitHub. Create a new list with links to repositories or specific issues you would be interested in contributing to during the internship.
- [ ] Write a short blog post describing things you’ve learned recently, and share it with us. The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Django and Wagtail

Here, we expect you to go through two tutorials to demonstrate your understanding of Django and Wagtail. Submit both projects you will have created as a pull request on this `gsoc` repository.

- [x] Go through Django’s [Getting started documentation and tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/intro/), until part 7.
- [x] Go through Wagtail’s Getting started tutorial: [Your first Wagtail site](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/getting_started/tutorial.html)
