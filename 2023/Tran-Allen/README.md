Hello everybody!

My name is Allen Tran and I'm currently a freshman studying Computer Science at the University of Southern California. I have a strong foundation in Python, C++, HTML/CSS, and React. As an aspiring open-source contributor, I plan to gain industry-leading experience with a variety of languages and get the feel of actually working for a company. I hope to treat GSoC as if it is an internship where I expect myself to become a better software engineer.

Aside from the technical side, I love the entrepreneurial side of it as well. I love the thought of getting to apply and build out your ideas by connecting the dots with the tools at your disposal. This is why I believe that Wagtail is such a great fit for me as it is a tool for the builder to create anything they want, even when there are coding limitations.

I hope to connect with you all, mentors and contributors alike, and I wish everyone the best!
