Hi Everyone!

I am Yaseen, hailing from Pakistan and currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in economics as a freshman at NUST, Islamabad. I am obsessed with coding, and I possess strong skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Python. For the past ten months, I have been acquainted with GSOC and after researching various organizations, I decided to work with Wagtail due to its compatibility with my existing skill set. However, I needed to learn Django and Git/Github to work on Wagtail, and for the past four months, I have been learning them along with SQL, CI/CD, and other important concepts. I've been learning them at a fast pace with ChatGPT!

Apart from the languages mentioned above, I also have basic knowledge of Java, Kotlin and Android development, but later, I found web development more intriguing, and hence, shifted my focus. I have a decent experience with Linux, having used Backtrack 5, Kali Linux, and Ubuntu, along with Windows, in dual boot mode for an extended period. Currently, I am using Ubuntu and Windows 10.

I am weary of going through W3Schools articles, HackerRank, and HackerEarth problems and watching CS50 videos. I crave to work on a substantial project and not be confined to the basics any longer.
