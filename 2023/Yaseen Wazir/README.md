## **My Intro**
Hi Everyone!

I am Yaseen, hailing from Pakistan and currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in economics as a freshman at NUST, Islamabad. I am obsessed with coding, and I possess strong skills in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and Python. For the past ten months, I have been acquainted with GSOC and after researching various organizations, I decided to work with Wagtail due to its compatibility with my existing skill set. However, I needed to learn Django and Git/Github to work on Wagtail, and for the past four months, I have been learning them along with SQL, CI/CD, and other important concepts. I've been learning them at a fast pace with ChatGPT!

Apart from the languages mentioned above, I also have basic knowledge of Java, Kotlin and Android development, but later, I found web development more intriguing, and hence, shifted my focus. I have a decent experience with Linux, having used Backtrack 5, Kali Linux, and Ubuntu, along with Windows, in dual boot mode for an extended period. Currently, I am using Ubuntu and Windows 10.

I am weary of going through W3Schools articles, HackerRank, and HackerEarth problems and watching CS50 videos. I crave to work on a substantial project and not be confined to the basics any longer.

### Checklist: interest in learning

With this checklist, we expect you to demonstrate an ability to do research and learn new things. All tasks here will require updating your participant file within this `gsoc` repository in the `2023/` folder.

The post must be in English, include at least one image, be less than 500 words, and score a Grade 6 or lower on <https://hemingwayapp.com/>. The post has to be posted on a publicly-available platform (Dev.to, Hashnode, Medium, your own website), and you must also add it as a new section in your personal file in this repository (so we can provide feedback on the contents).

### Checklist: Django and Wagtail

Here, we expect you to go through two tutorials to demonstrate your understanding of Django and Wagtail. Submit both projects you will have created as a pull request on this `gsoc` repository.
