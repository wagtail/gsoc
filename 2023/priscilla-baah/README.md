## **Introduction**

Hello everyone ! ðŸ‘‹

I am Priscilla, a beginner software developer based in Accra, Ghana currently making a career pivot from finance and data science. I have been working primarily with Django as a backend developer with substantial knowledge of JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

I am very curious about how software at enterprise level works, and for me GSOC and open source in general is a great avenue to learn about and contribute to such projects within a community context.
I am passionate about continuous learning and knowledge sharing through community engagements as I have shown in my career and volunteering initiatives as a trainer and mentor for others in their early career.

In my work I am always looking for ways to improve efficiency and make things easier for others. This, combined with my experience in Django is why I am heavily interested in working on the background workers project for Wagtail. 
Going through slack conversations and comments here, I love the effort that Wagtail puts into creating a very diverse and welcoming community for all contributors, and I am very happy to be a part of the community.
