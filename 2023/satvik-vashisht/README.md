## **Introduction**

I'm Satvik Vashisht, a second-year undergrad based in India. I've been contributing to Wagtail for two months now and have already made some valuable contributions. My main areas of interest within Wagtail are front-end design and performance optimization. In addition to my proficiency in Python, HTML, CSS, and C++, I also have experience working with Django and Git. Contributing to Wagtail has been an excellent learning experience for me, and I'm excited to continue contributing and improving my skills as a developer.
