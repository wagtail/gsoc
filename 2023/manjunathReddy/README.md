## **Introduction**
- Hey everyone, I am Manjunath from Hyderabad, India. I have been working as an Network Automation Engineer for past 10 months.
I mainly worked on technologies such as python and Selenium framework. I have partly worked on Django and C++ as well. Although I haven't worked on HTML,CSS and JavaScript in the live environment, I do have knowledge on those technologies as well.
- As a student who got Graduated in 2022 and willing to work on improving my skills, Open source community provides a great chance to chase my short and long term goals. This is my first time contributing to an open source projects and I'm really excited to contribute to wagtail, as it is widely used by the organisations.
- To be part of an open source community itself will be an achievement for any individual and to be part of Wagtail open source community via GSoC platform adds more value and great leaning experience.
