# Introduction
Hello, team wagtail,
Vibhakar from India, trying again this year to contribute to the wagtail project.
I have been using wagtail for over 4 years now and have a pretty good understanding of both contributing and the ecosystem,
I have been developing [bfportal.gg](https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/bfportal.gg) for quite some time now it just recently crossed 2k users :), so big thanks to the team for creating and maintaining this project ,
Hoping to contribute to the project one way or the other :)
