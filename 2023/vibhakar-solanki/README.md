# Introduction
Hello, team wagtail,
Vibhakar from India, trying again this year to contribute to the wagtail project.
I have been using wagtail for over 4 years now and have a pretty good understanding of both contributing and the ecosystem,
I have been developing [bfportal.gg](https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/bfportal.gg) for quite some time now it just recently crossed 2k users :), so big thanks to the team for creating and maintaining this project ,
Hoping to contribute to the project one way or the other :)

            - A lot of modules are still not headless in wagtail, I think it would be a great project to make more parts on wagtail headless. 
            - todo:
                - make a list of modules that need headless support

- ### Write up
    - <details>
        <summary>Click to show</summary>

        At the start of the year, I decided that I will be learning `Rust`. For, the next month I was learning the basics of Rust. The borrow checker in rust was a new concept for me. The last static language that I used was C++ and I was not familiar with the concept of ownership. I was able to learn the basics of Rust in a month. I was able to build a simple CLI application in Rust. Currently, I am in the last chapter of the book about building a `web server in Rust`. Then as January came to a close, I was very interested in ChatGPT. The more I looked into it, the more I got interested in `data science` and machine learning. I spent most of my time completing the course "Deep Learning A-Z‚Ñ¢ 2023: Neural Networks" on udemy. I learned concepts like ANN, CNN, and Boltzmann Machine. During this time I also played with `Wagtail API` for bfportal.gg.  
        
        I wanted to expose the creator of an experience in the API. But as the creator is a nested user field it can't be in the API as a field of its own. So I made use of `@property` so that a function can resolve the nested property into a single value. 
        
        Then google shared accepted GSOC orgs with us. I am excited as both Wagtail and Django got selected. Then came march and I wanted to get selected as a GSOC contributor this year. I started contributing to Django and got my first PR in the project approved and merged üòÅ . 
        
        During this month bfportal had two major events. Its userbase crossed 2k users and migrating the project to use Python 3.11. I was also using `runserver` in production but now the project uses `gunicorn`. 
        
        That gave the project a very very good performance boost (I've attached the usage graph). Currently, I'm preparing for my Maths exam (is on the 28th of march) and drafting my proposal for GSOC.
