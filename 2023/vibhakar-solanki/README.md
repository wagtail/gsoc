# Introduction
Hello, team wagtail,
Vibhakar from India, trying again this year to contribute to the wagtail project.
I have been using wagtail for over 4 years now and have a pretty good understanding of both contributing and the ecosystem,
I have been developing [bfportal.gg](https://github.com/battlefield-portal-community/bfportal.gg) for quite some time now it just recently crossed 2k users :), so big thanks to the team for creating and maintaining this project ,
Hoping to contribute to the project one way or the other :)

## Research

- ### Resources
    - **Helping Material**
        - [Wagtail's official docs](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/)
        - [Wagtail's Source Code](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) Especially to understand how wagtail API works
        - [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/) Best place to get usual questions answered.
    - **Projects I'm interested in**
        - [RFC 72: Background workers](https://github.com/RealOrangeOne/wagtail-rfcs/blob/wagtail-background-workers/text/072-background-workers.md)
        - [RFC 81: StreamField-based rich text](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/81) Although currently not accepted, I would also love this to be in wagtail admin, the current editor has broken for me on more than one occasion.
        - [RFC 53: Swappable Page model](https://github.com/sonnybaker/rfcs/blob/master/text/053-swappable-page-model.md)
    - **Exploring Organization**
        - [bakerydemo](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo)
            - [ Make the demo more suitable for Wagtail testing #175 ](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo/issues/175)
            - [ Add Site Setting to the demo #395 ](https://github.com/wagtail/bakerydemo/issues/395) ( should be fairly simple, will do this one regardless )
        - [Wagtail Autocomplete](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-autocomplete)
            - [ Autocomplete Manager #50 ](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-autocomplete/issues/50)
        - [Wagtail Headless]
            - A lot of modules are still not headless in wagtail, I think it would be a great project to make more parts on wagtail headless. 
            - todo:
                - make a list of modules that need headless support
