# Introduction:

Hello everybody,

Myself Amey Shinde. I am a CS Junior from the University of Texas at Arlington, US and I am currently working as a Research Assistant with the CS department at our university. I have been using wagtail for quite some time now and am excited to participate in wagtail's GSoC this year.

I had applied to GSoC organization last year however, I had no luck getting selected. This year I have more knowledge and am confident about making a contribution.

Also a fun fact about me. My hobbies are producing music and djing.
