## Project ideas

🚧 we have split our one "Greener coding" project idea in two separate projects: _front-end_, and _back-end_, as there are a high number of tasks involved. Both projects can be delivered successfully completely independently, and we expect them both to be equally interesting.

- [Greener coding: Wagtail’s climate impact - front-end development](#greener-coding-wagtails-climate-impact---front-end-development)
- [Greener coding: Wagtail’s climate impact - back-end development](#greener-coding-wagtails-climate-impact---back-end-development)

### Greener coding: Wagtail’s climate impact - front-end development

#### Summary

We’re starting to have a better understanding of the [climate impact of Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/discussions/8843) as a CMS, and how we can reduce it. We want to integrate our findings into Wagtail’s direction, and make concrete improvements to the project to reduce related carbon emissions.

#### Expected outcomes

The climate impact of Wagtail sites will be measurable with agreed-upon methodologies, and we will do so on a regular basis. By the end of the project, we will have released a number of energy efficiency improvements reducing the impact of Wagtail sites (image optimisation, better caching, scale-to-zero setup).

#### Implementation

We can:

1. Research how leading CMS projects are doing this.
2. Produce a report on the climate impact of Wagtail sites at this point in time.
3. Update our tooling to make it easier to evaluate energy efficiency on a regular basis.
4. Plan 5-10 sustainability-related changes to Wagtail
5. Implement 3-5 of these changes

An example of such a change would be support for [responsive image optimisations](https://github.com/wagtail/rfcs/pull/71) in Wagtail.

Another example would be [themes for the admin interface](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail/issues/10056) – a dark theme is under way, which could be extended with a "high contrast" version if there are energy consumption benefits. The themes could display fewer images, and make use of advanced browser features such as [prefers-reduced-data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-data) to further reduce the impact of browsing the CMS for users who choose to change their experience.

#### Skills

This project is suitable with a wide range of skillsets, we can adjust tasks accordingly.

- Python
- Django
- Performance
- DevOps

#### Mentors

- Lead: Thibaud Colas
- Support: Sage Abdullah
- Support 2: Chris Adams

#### Size

175 hours or 350 hours

### Greener coding: Wagtail’s climate impact - back-end development

### Project proposal: your own idea

You can also propose your own idea. Your proposal should:

- Have a concrete task.
- Give a solid idea of what will constitute success. You tell us.
- Present a detailed design specification.
- Give insight into who you are. If you propose something ambitious, convince us that you are up to the task.
- Give insight into your previous projects and experience.
- Tell us about your experience with Python/Django/Wagtail.
- Provide a schedule, including a detailed work breakdown and major milestones.
- Contain your motivation and curriculum vitae.

Here is an example of [an accepted proposal](https://gist.github.com/chrismedrela/82cbda8d2a78a280a129) on Django.

Note:

- The project ideas above are starting points for your submission, but aren’t enough by themselves. You’ll need to come up with a more complete project plan, and use your own words.
- Do not feel limited to the project ideas below.
- If you have a project idea not listed, please direct message the [organisation admins](#organisation-admins). They can test the project eligibility and pair you with a mentor for initial feedback.

Project proposals should fall into one of three categories:

- Work on Wagtail itself. The core product.
- Work on tools to support Wagtail. Example: Editor guide as a Wagtail website.
- Wagtail third-party libraries. Example: [Wagtail Live](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail-live) is a GSOC 2021 project.

The project you propose should be:

- Something useful for the Wagtail project
- A single well-scoped project
- Achievable within the time of GSoC
- And something the core developers can help mentor you on.
