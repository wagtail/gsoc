Lourdu Radjou

## Introduction

Hello everyone, myself Lourdu Radjou (Lou), I am a full stack developer having wide range of experience in multiple tech stack including Javascript, Python, Reactjs and Django. And creating websites focusing on UX/UI first approach and long term scalable architecture in mind.

My reason for choosing Wagtail after long search was, I really like the approach of this organization and providing a way for organization to control CMS with lot of customization. I have experience of working in healthcare industry , the potential of open source CMS is enormous.

I am especially interested in contributing to the Multilingual Support project with focus on accessibility and long term sustainability for everyone in terms of making critical decisions, architecture and code quality.

I am also interested in contributing to docs and others areas like having a Simple Interactive Walkthrough to help Non-Technical people, which I feel our wagtail core package misses right now. Having experienced partial hearing loss earlier in my life, I understand how important inclusive design is.

Looking for a long term community driver contribution journey, Thank you!!
