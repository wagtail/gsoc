Hi, my name is Vaishhnavi Kadiyala. I am a Computer Science student and an aspiring backend developer interested in contributing to Wagtail for Google Summer of Code 2026.

I have hands-on experience with Python, Django, JavaScript, and building full-stack web applications. I have worked on backend systems involving REST APIs, database design, authentication, and automation workflows. I am particularly interested in Django-based systems and content management platforms like Wagtail.

I enjoy working with open source, learning from real-world codebases, and improving software through meaningful contributions. I am currently exploring the Wagtail codebase and bakerydemo project to understand its architecture and identify areas for improvement.

I look forward to contributing to the Wagtail community, improving my skills, and collaborating with mentors and contributors.
