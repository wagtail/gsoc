# Ankit Chaudhary
## Introduction

Hi everyone, My name is Ankit Chaudhary currently in my 2nd year of B-Tech (Information Technology). I am a Full-Stack developer and have solid experience with tools and frameworks like: **Django** and **ReactJS**. 
I love to build cool and scalable projects. I am learning django for a while now, and for past few months learning and contributing to Open-Source Codebases. <br><br>
I have made some contribution to **Wagtail Codebase**  and learning something new from each contribution. <br><br>
I am applying for **GSOC 2026** with Wagtail, personally interested in **Starter Kit Upgrade** project, and looking forward to make meaningful contribution to the community.
