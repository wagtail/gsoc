## Introduction

Hi everyone, I’m a Django backend developer and I’m excited to contribute to Wagtail through GSoC 2026.

I’m currently interested in contributing to low- and medium-level projects where I can make steady, meaningful contributions, learn from the community, and grow as an open source contributor.

## Contributions
