## Introduction
Hello! this is Srinithi Vijayakumar, I am excited to contribute to Wagtail for GSoC 2026.
I am interested in the Wagtail Bakery demo I personally feel that, that's an awesome enough project to inspire and motivate a person like me who is currently learning UI/UX designing tools like figma and backend (Nodejs,React and Express.js) and already knows frontend like HTML, CSS and JS and programming languages python, java and C++(learning) and MySQL (database).
For a first year BTech CSE student like me this serves a very good opportunity to show and grow my skills with Wagtail. Wagtail offers a fast, flexible and elegant way to give everyone the tools that they need to manage at the enterprise scale.
