## Introduction

Hi, I'm a fullstack web developer that deals mostly with Django but also strong on the frontend with React. I'm interested in contributing to Wagtail for GSoC and what genuinely drew me in was the accessibility-first approach, it's something I care about deeply and don't see prioritized enough in the web space.

I've contributed to open source a twice times before and I've already started setting up the local dev environment. I'd love to work on the Demo website redesign . Looking forward to getting to know the community!

### Project idea

The Bakery Demo website redesign

I'm particularly excited about the Demo Website Redesign project because it plays directly to my strengths as a fullstack developer. Having experience in both Django and frontend development means I can contribute meaningfully at every layer of the stack, from backend logic to bringing the UI team's designs to life. Reimagining the bakery demo into something that better represents real-world Wagtail projects is a challenge I'm genuinely eager to take on.
