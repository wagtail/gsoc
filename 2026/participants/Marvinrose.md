# Marvinrose Chibuezem

## Introduction
Hello everyone, I'm Marvinrose Chibuezem, a fullstack web developer with experience in Python, Django and JavaScript/React. I'm excited to be a part of this community and very eager to contribute to wagtail for GSoC. 

I'm interested in the Multilingual Support Improvements project. I've set up wagtail locally and I'm genuinely excited about making Wagtail better for the millions of users running multilingual websites. Looking forward to contributing, collaborating and learning with you all.
