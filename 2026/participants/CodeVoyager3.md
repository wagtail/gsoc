# Amritesh Kumar Rai

## Introduction

Hi everyone! I’m Amritesh, a second-year Computer Science Engineering student from New Delhi, India. I’m a full-stack developer who enjoys turning ideas into clean, functional, and interactive web applications. I primarily work with React, Node.js, and Express, and recently I’ve been diving deeper into Python and Django to broaden my backend expertise. 

I’m particularly interested in the Starter Kit Upgrade project. I’m excited about the opportunity to join the Wagtail community for GSoC 2026, where I hope to strengthen my Python and Django skills while contributing meaningfully to world-class CMS tooling.

### Project idea: Starter kit upgrade

I’m genuinely excited about the Starter Kit Upgrade project because it aligns perfectly with my frontend background and my goal of mastering Django. I’ve experienced firsthand how challenging it can be to connect a robust CMS with a modern or decoupled frontend, and I understand the friction developers face during setup.

I believe a well-crafted starter kit can dramatically improve the developer experience. I’d love to help build a modern, production ready template , potentially exploring a headless approach or integrating contemporary frontend tooling—that makes launching a Wagtail application smoother and more accessible.
